Arduino-TestSuite
-----------------

### Arduino TestSuite to automate Arduino unit tests

 * The unit tests are written with the "Arduino Unit Testing Library": http://code.google.com/p/arduinounit
 * The tests also use "Arduino Unit Testing Helper Library": http://code.google.com/p/arduino-unit-test-helper-library
 * The code is uploaded to the Arduino board with "Arscons: scons script for Arduino": http://github.com/suapapa/arscons

### Program flow: 
The steps are performed for each set of unit tests (typically to test one Arduino library)
   1. Compile a sketch that runs several unit tests
   2. Upload and run the sketch using Arscons
   3. Check unit test output

These steps are repeated for all the libraries that you are using in the project.

The script prints a summary showing an overview of the failed/passed test.
