# Arduino TestSuite to automate unit tests on the Arduino platform
# Copyright (C) 2012  Jeroen Doggen <jeroendoggen@gmail.com>
#
# Version History:
#  - Version 0.1: call scons
#                 run unit test
#                 print summary
#
#  - Version 0.2: subprocess for arscons
#                 classes: Test, TestSuite, InfoPrinter
#                 Divided the code in several modules
#
# Roadmap:
#  - report failed uploads, skip further testing?
#  - accept commandline parameters (options, silent, debug,..)
#  - logging to a file
#  - what to to when arscons fails? (how to report?)
