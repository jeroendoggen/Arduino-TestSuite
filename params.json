Compile a sketch that runs several unit tests\r\n   2. Upload and run the sketch using Arscons\r\n   3. Check unit test output\r\n\r\nSteps 1,2 and 3 are repeated for all the libraries that you are using in the project.\r\n\r\nThe script prints a summary showing an overview of the failed/passed test in the complete testsuite.","name":"Arduino TestSuite"}
