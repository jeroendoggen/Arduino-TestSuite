{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"This Python scripts allows automated running of several Arduino unit tests.\r\nThe testing process is started on the PC but the tests run on the actual Arduino hardware.\r\nOne set of unit tests is typically used to test one Arduino library.\r\n\r\nThe following steps are performed for each set of unit tests:\r\n 1. The script compiles and uploads an Arduino sketch that contains the unit testing.\r\n 2. The unit tests are run on the Arduino board.\r\n 3. The results of the test are printed over the serial port and analyzed by the Python script.\r\n 4. The script starts the next test, repeating steps 1,2 and 3 for all test that are requested in the configuration file.\r\n  The script prints a summary showing an overview of all the failed/passed tests in the complete testsuite.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-------------\r\n * Downloads source and run ``python setup.py install``\r\n * Python Package available in the Python Package Index at: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ArduinoTestSuite/ (``pip install ArduinoTestSuite``)\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n------\r\n * Start the program with: ``python -m ArduinoTestSuite`` (or ``python main.py``)\r\n * Select the tests you want to run by editing: ``planned-tests.conf``\r\n * Getting help: ``python -m ArduinoTestSuite --help``\r\n * Post issues to GitHub <http://github.com/jeroendoggen/Arduino-TestSuite/issues>.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n-------------\r\n * The unit tests are written with the \"Arduino Unit Testing Library\": http://code.google.com/p/arduinounit\r\n * The tests also use \"Arduino Unit Testing Helper Library\": http://code.google.com/p/arduino-unit-test-helper-library\r\n * The code is uploaded to the Arduino board with \"Arscons: scons script for Arduino\": http://github.com/suapapa/arscons\r\n * Python 2.6+ packages: pyserial\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n------------\r\n * Currently only tested on Linux\r\n  * Default paths are configured for Linux\r\n  * Subprocess handling only works on Linux\r\n * The program was created with other OS users in mind, so it will eventually get full cross-platform support. Help from Windows-developers is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nLicense:\r\n--------\r\nIf not stated otherwise ArduinoTestSuite is distributed in terms of the GPLv2 software license.\r\nSee COPYING in the distribution for details.\r\n\r\nTypical Output:\r\n---------------\r\nIn this examples, two Arduino libraries are tested, one passes, one fails.\r\n\r\n````\r\n=============================================================\r\nPlanned tests:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n 1.
